# Procedural Generator

**Table of Contents**

This is a hobby project aiming to create a open world using only procedural generation. The scope of this project is to learn more about procedural generation and apply various OpenGL techniques to get a good grip  in both.

Right now I am developing in my free time amid work schedule. So the development is slow.

### Features

- Globally iluminated Light.
- Generate terrains procedurally.
- Create varying terrains by controlling  Octaves / Lacunarity / Persistance. 
- Texture terrains with texture splatting.
- Generate vegetations using L systems.
- Load any custom object(obj) then combine L system based procedural drawing with positioning to create beautiful landscapes.

### Features in Work
- Exposing APIs for usage by others.
- Multiple light sources and Skybox
- procedure controllable GUI for Terrain and vegetation.
- procedural city scape

## Techniques used

- Using Perlin noise to generate the terrain. The terrain's height and smoothness can be controlled by varying the parameters. 
- Using L system grammar to generate various trees.
